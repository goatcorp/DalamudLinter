  name: Private XIVLauncher dependency reference
  severity: warn
  description: |-
    A XIVLauncher dependency is referenced as private.

    Private dependency references are copied into the project's
    output folder, which is usually undesired for dependencies
    included with XIVLauncher.
  fix: |-
    Set the Private tag of the dependency reference to false.
  csproj: >-
    /Project
    /ItemGroup
    /Reference[@Include]
      [contains(HintPath/text(), 'XIVLauncher')]
      [not(Private[lower-case(text()) = 'false'])]

- code: D0002
  name: Version-specific XIVLauncher dependency reference
  severity: warn
  description: |-
    A XIVLauncher dependency is referenced by a specific version.

    This will cause breakage when compiling after the dependency has
    been updated.
  fix: |-
    Remove everything after the comma in the Include attribute of
    the Reference tag.
  csproj: /Project/ItemGroup/Reference[contains(@Include, ',')]

- code: D0003
  name: Public dependency missing reference to AppData in HintPath
  severity: warn
  description: |-
    A dependency reference is missing a HintPath that references the
    AppData variable.

    For most developers' environments, this will result in the
    dependency not being found.
  fix: |-
    Add a HintPath that references $(AppData).
  csproj: >-
    /Project
    /ItemGroup
    /Reference[@Include]
      [Private[lower-case(text()) = 'false']]
      [not(HintPath[contains(lower-case(text()), '$(appdata)')])]
#      [HintPath[contains(lower-case(text()), 'xivlauncher')]]
#  csproj: /Project/ItemGroup/Reference[@Include][not(HintPath[contains(text(), '$(')])]

  name: Non-SDK-style Project
  severity: error
  description: |-
    The project is configured in a non-SDK style.

    See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/project-sdk/overview
  fix: |-
    Remove ToolsVersion attribute and instead add an Sdk attribute
    from the URL below.

  csproj: /Project[@ToolsVersion or not(@Sdk = 'Microsoft.NET.Sdk' or starts-with(@Sdk, 'Microsoft.NET.Sdk.'))]

  name: Invalid TargetFramework
  severity: error
  description: |-
    The project is targeting an invalid framework.
  fix: |-
    Set TargetFramework to net5.0-windows or net5-windows.
  csproj: /Project/PropertyGroup/TargetFramework[text() != 'net5-windows' and text() != 'net5.0-windows']

  name: ProduceReferenceAssembly enabled
  severity: warn
  description: |-
    The project is missing a ProduceReferenceAssembly tag set to
    false.

    When ProduceReferenceAssembly is missing or set to true, a
    reference assembly will be generated in the output folder. This is
    almost always undesired behaviour for a plugin.
  fix: |-
    Set the ProduceReferenceAssembly tag to false.
  show_context: false
  csproj: /Project[not(PropertyGroup/ProduceReferenceAssembly[lower-case(text()) = 'false'])]

- code: D0007
  name: PackageReference without CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies
  severity: warn
  description: |-
    One or more PackageReference tags are specified, but no
    CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies tag is set to true.

    In this configuration, the assemblies for the PackageReference
    dependencies will not be copied to the output folder, which will
    almost always result in load errors.
  fix: |-
    Set the CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies tag to true.
  show_context: false
  csproj: >-
    /Project
      [ItemGroup/PackageReference[@Include and @Version]]
      [not(PropertyGroup/CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies[lower-case(text()) = 'true'])]

  name: ImGuiScene reference
  severity: warn
  description: |-
    The project references the ImGuiScene assembly.

    In the past, referencing ImGuiScene was necessary in order to use
    ImGui. However, Dalamud has since updated to remove this
    constraint. There is now almost no reason to reference ImGuiScene,
    and it is almost always unnecessary.
  fix: |-
    Remove the reference.
  csproj: >-
    /Project
    /ItemGroup
    /Reference[@Include = 'ImGuiScene' or starts-with(@Include, 'ImGuiScene,')]

- code: D0009
  name: Dependency reference to specific Dalamud release
  severity: warn
  description: |-
    A dependency reference is pinned to a specific Dalamud release.

    This is often a mistake, as most developers will want to target
    the dev "release" to compile against the latest assemblies
    included with Dalamud.
  fix: |-
    Replace the reference to a specific release with dev.
  csproj: >-
    /Project
    /ItemGroup
    /Reference[@Include]
      [HintPath[contains(lower-case(text()), 'xivlauncher')]]
      [not(
        contains(HintPath/text(), '\dev\')
          or contains(HintPath/text(), '/dev/')
      )]
